# SVG Logo Maker

A Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.

The [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) was used to ease the processes of asking questions, parsing input, validating answers, and managing hierarchical prompts.

The [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) was used for running the unit tests.
